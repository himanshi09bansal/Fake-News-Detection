# Fake-News-Detection


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop a deep learning program to identify when an article might be fake news. 
First of all, convert text data to numerical data using NLP and then predict whether the news is fake or real using an Artificial Neural Network.

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES
Predict whether the news is fake or real.

## DATASET
üîµ A whole training dataset has the following attributes: <br/>
<b> Id	</b>: 	unique id for a news article <br/> 
<b>Title </b>: 	the title of a news article <br/>
<b> Text </b>: 	the text of the article; incomplete in some cases <br/>
<b> Label	</b>: 	a label that marks the article as possibly erratic <br/>
&emsp 1: fake <br/>
&emsp 0: real <br/>


## END OF THE PROGRAM
In the end, you can see the accuracy of all the algorithms in a graphical way.
